The main point of entry is the init() function in the 06_tc_controller.js file.

Note: the audio file loader uses XMLHttpRequest(), which means that the media
files must be located on an actual web server. If you open the index.html file
locally, you will see a lot of errors about XMLHttpRequest, since these URLs
will be relative to a file:// and not http:// protocol.

You can either start a local web server on your machine, or upload these files
to a web server.
